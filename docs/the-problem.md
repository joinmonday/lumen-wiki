# The Problem
With the increase of people going online for the job search, how can we make it more efficient?

## Finding talent is slow
There is not a reputation system that job seekers and employers can use to trust one another with confidence. This slows down the speed at which job seekers and employers can find each other without intermediaries.

Today, LinkedIn is the world’s most powerful tool for job-seeking professionals and employers. Unfortunately, LinkedIn's doesn’t offer a trusted reputation system.

## Skill sets are not verified
A significant fraction of LinkedIn members have included education and skills in their profiles. But this information is shallow: people are mostly honest when they list their skills and credentials, but there’s no way to know how good they are at the skills they claim.


## Users don't own their information
Today, when professionals use current professional platforms like LinkedIn, they do not own their information. They are ignorant to how much profit LinkedIn is making out of their data.

This problem happens because those platforms are centralized and their business model relies on the attention of each user. The more engaged users are on the platform, the more money that those platforms can make.
